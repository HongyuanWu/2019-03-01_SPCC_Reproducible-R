Does our bottle machine fill each bottle with 750 mL of beer (on average)?

## Data

I selected 50 bottles at random from the Dublin factory, which contained the following amounts of beer (mL):

TODO

The mean amount is **TODO**.

## Reasoning

The amounts of beer in our bottles should be normally distributed with a mean of 750 mL and a standard deviation of 3 mL. Let's use simulation to calculate the sample means of 1000 samples of size 50 generated from such a distribution.

TODO - ADD PLOT HERE

I've plotted the distribution of the simulated means above. The blue line shows our observed sample mean. Notice that TODO of the simulations produced a sample mean as extreme as ours (p-value = TODO). In other words, our observations TODO.

## Conclusion

We TODO have evidence that the bottle machine is malfunctioning.
